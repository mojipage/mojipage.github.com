    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MojiPage attended two events during <a href="http://www.internetweekny.com/">Internet Week New York</a> – <a href="http://www.internetmarketingconference.com/newyork2008/index.html">IMC NY 2008</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/05/01/mashables-exhibit-hall-for-internet-week-ny-call-for-sponsors/">Mashable’s Exhibit Hall</a>.</p>

<p>At IMC NY, we shared with people our love for mobile widgets (as always!),  and talked about using mobile widgets in marketing campaigns.  We met, listened to and exchanged ideas with folks from many interesting mobile contents and service providers like <a href="http://socialight.com/">Socialight</a>, <a href="http://www.yojomobile.com/">Yojo Mobile</a> (creators of <a href="http://www.mizpee.com/">MizPee</a>), <a href="http://winksite.com/">Winksite</a> and <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">BlogTalkRadio</a> to name but a few.</p>

<p>If you've missed IMC NY, you can find a summary of the day’s event and videos on some sessions at: http://www.webanalysts.info/webanalytics/imc-new-york-2008/</p>

<p>Here's clip on our session, <em>Widgets in Motion - Syndication Beyond the Desktop</em></p>

<p>Big thanks to Lars Johansson and Lennart Svanberg once again for organizing the event.  We look forward to participating in the next IMC in Vancouver this September.</p>

<p>Mashable's Exhibit Hall (and networking party) was at the theatre district’s Touch lounge. It was packed by the time we got there. There were several web2.0 startups doing show-and-tell.  Other than the bar, we spent most of our time loitering around <a href="http://www.cafemom.com/">CafeMom</a>’s booth. It seemed strange at first that they would be giving out oven mitts as swags, but the mitts really came in handy when holding cold beers. CafeMom may sound like a niche idea to some, but if you do your math on how many new mums there are out there, these folks are dealing with a huge community here. And although we didn’t spend much time talking to the folks exhibiting <a href="http://concertattack.com/">ConcertAttack</a>, this is another social media site that we like a lot.  Focused on live concert contents, these guys make it really easy for fans and artists to share. We can’t wait to see what these 2 companies will bring to the mobile space down the road.  Lots of cool mobile widgets, please!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.internetmarketingconference.com/"><img src="/images/2008/05/imcinternational.gif" alt="IMC Logo" /></a> MojiPage will be presenting  at the <a href="http://www.internetmarketingconference.com/">Internet Marketing Conference</a> (IMC) in New York on June 4th, 2008. The theme at this IMC event is "Mobile Marketing: The Next Evolution" and that, to us, has the word WIDGETS written all over it.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.internetmarketingconference.com/agenda.html">agenda</a>, here's what we're gonna be talking about:</p>

<blockquote><p>Widgets have been used with great success on social media sites. Until now, they were confined to the desktop. As mobile platforms become more sophisticated, and as widget container applications gain widespread acceptance, there has never been a better time to get ready to ride the next big wave.</p></blockquote>

<p>We will look at how companies can leverage mobile widgets to syndicate their content and capture the attention of users when they're on the move.</p>

<p>If you plan to be in the area at that time, please join us at the conference by registering <a href="http://www.regonline.com/imc_nyc_2008">here</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally,  this is part of <a href="http://www.internetweekny.com/">Internet Week New York</a> (3rd - 10th June) along with many other interesting events. We might hop into <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/05/01/mashables-exhibit-hall-for-internet-week-ny-call-for-sponsors/">Mashable's Exhibit Hall</a>.</p>
